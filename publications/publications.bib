% Define venue/journal string here and reuse in your bib entries for
% consistency. I include a list of many of the venues I often cite below.
% There are several reasons for doing this:
%
% Consistency: many online sources list the same venues slightly differently.
%
% History: Many journals/conferences have complicated histories. Some
% conferences change name (e.g., the rendering workshop turning into the
% rendering symposium), they also change the way they are published (e.g.,
% starting in 2008 EGSR is published in the journal Computer Graphics Forum).
%
% Define a string eliminates the need to remember the exact cutoffs and names.

  abstract={Pair Correlation Functions (PCF) have been recently spreading as a reliable representation for distributions, enabling the
			efficient synthesis of point-sets, vector textures and object placement from examples. In this work we introduce a triangulationbased
			local filtering method to extend PCF-based analysis to exemplars with free-form boundaries. This makes PCF applicable
			to new problems such as the inpainting of missing parts in an input distribution, or the decomposition of complex,
			non-homogeneous distributions into a set of coherent classes, in which each category of points can be studied together with
			their intra and inter-class correlations.},

  abstract={Multi-view stereo can be used to rapidly create realistic virtual
			content, such as textured meshes or a geometric proxy for freeviewpoint
			Image-Based Rendering (IBR). These solutions greatly simplify the content
			creation process compared to traditional methods, but it is difficult to modify
			the content of the scene.We propose a novel approach to create scenes by
			composing (parts of) multiple captured scenes. The main difficulty of such
			compositions is that lighting conditions in each captured scene are different;
			to obtain a realistic composition we need to make lighting coherent. We propose
			a two-pass solution, by adapting a multi-view relighting network. We first match
			the lighting conditions of each scene separately and then synthesize shadows
			between scenes in a subsequent pass. We also improve the realism of the
			composition by estimating the change in ambient occlusion in contact areas
			between parts and compensate for the color balance of the different cameras used
			for capture. We illustrate our method with results on multiple compositions of
			outdoor scenes and show its application to multi-view image composition, IBR and
			textured mesh creation.},
